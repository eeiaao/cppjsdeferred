A library simplifying asynchronous interaction between Qt and QML.  
Provides a bridge between asynchronous operations in C++ backend and user interface written in QML.  
Create a promise on C++ side, return it to QML, tune on a reaction, then resolve or reject the promise with necessary arguments when appropriate. That's it.
